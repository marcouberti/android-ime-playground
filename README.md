# Android IME playground

An input method editor (IME) is a user control that enables users to enter text. Android provides an extensible input-method framework that allows applications to provide users alternative input methods, such as on-screen keyboards or even speech input. After installing the desired IMEs, a user can select which one to use from the system settings, and use it across the entire system; only one IME may be enabled at a time.
